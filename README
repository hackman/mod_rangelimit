This module aims to provide protection from the DoS attacks using the Range header in Apache.

It does so by analyzing the ranges supplied in the Range header.

It is checking the headers before mod_setenvif and if there is even one invalid range in the request the whole request is declined.

The module also checks the number of supplied ranges and the number of overlapping ranges.

The module provides two options:
  MaxRanges
  MaxOverlappingRanges

By default the module is configured with the following values:
  MaxRanges - 20
  MaxOverlappingRanges - 5
